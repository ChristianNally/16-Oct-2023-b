# W08D03 - Unit & Integration Testing

### To Do
- [x] Tools for testing React
- [x] Add Features/Tests to our App
- [x] `debug()` and `prettyDOM()`
- [x] Mocking AJAX Requests and Functions

### Types of Testing
* Static -> linters
* Manual -> dev runs the code
* Unit -> testing the smallest pieces of our code (functions)
* Integration -> testing pieces of our app together (components)
* End-to-end -> testing full features like a user would
* A & B -> testing multiple different versions of something
* Regression -> testing to make sure that old bugs do not re-emerge
